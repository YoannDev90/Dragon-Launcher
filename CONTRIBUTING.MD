# Contribute to Dragon Launcher

## Issues:
 - Read previous, check for no duplicate
 - Try restarting app; clearing cache/data update to latest release/beta

## Pull Requests:
 - If you plan to make big modifications, ask me before, to avoid wasting time


## My values
 - Always let the user the choice: everything should be customizable, that's why I have a kinda robust settings stores system aligned with the backups
 - Never ANY internet access
 - Entirely open source

## Code styles
 - Always add spaces between brackets in function declaration, condition statement
```kotlin
fun foo() {
    if (cond) {
        bar()
    }
}
```

- When possible, try to add lots of docstring and comments on code to make it more clear for reviewing
- Use this char in comments cause I like it
```text
─
```

Ex:
```kotlin
/*  ─────────────  Tags constants  ─────────────  */
```

 - Put else statements in the same line as the closing if:
```kotlin
if (cond) {
    doSomething()
} else {
    doSomethingElse()
}
```
